      </p>
      <h3>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the &ldquo;controller&rdquo; in the GDPR)</h3>
      <p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
      <p>
        Max Atslega
        <br />
        Holzhofstra&szlig;e 14C
        <br />
        32791 Lage
      </p>
      <p>
        Phone: 05232 9287212
        <br />
        E-mail: contact@atslega.network
      </p>
      <p>
        The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions
        as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
      </p>
      <h3>Storage duration</h3>
      <p>
        Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain
        with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for
        deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
        permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the
        latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
      </p>
      <h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>
      <p>
        If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or
        Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of
        explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art.
        49 (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end
        device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG. The
        consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the
        implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore,
        if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c)
        GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to
        Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following
        paragraphs of this privacy policy.
      </p>
      <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</h3>
      <p>
        Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a data protection
        perspective non-secure non-EU countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may potentially be
        transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a
        data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises
        are under a mandate to release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data subject do not have
        any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the
        Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal data for surveillance purposes. We
        have no control over these processing activities.
      </p>
      <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
      <p>
        A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also
        revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of
        any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
      </h3>
      <p>
        IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME
        OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO
        APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
        DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER
        PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS
        FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE
        PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT
        TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO
        APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR
        PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART.
        21(2) GDPR).
      </p>
      <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency,
        in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place
        where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other
        administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.
      </p>
      <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of
        a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should demand the
        direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
      </p>
      <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
      <p>
        Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your
        archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at any
        time. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this
        subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.
      </p>
      <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
        concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in
        the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some
          time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand
          that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand
          the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
          entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of
          its eradication.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
          weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right
          to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; with the exception of their
        archiving &ndash; may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal
        entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public
        interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.
      </p>
      <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
      <p>
        For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
        inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program.
        You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
        &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
      </p>
      <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
      <h2>4. Online-based Audio and Video Conferences (Conference tools)</h2>
      <h4>Data processing</h4>
      <p>
        We use online conference tools, among other things, for communication with our customers. The tools we use are
        listed in detail below. If you communicate with us by video or audio conference using the Internet, your
        personal data will be collected and processed by the provider of the respective conference tool and by us. The
        conferencing tools collect all information that you provide/access to use the tools (email address and/or your
        phone number). Furthermore, the conference tools process the duration of the conference, start and end (time) of
        participation in the conference, number of participants and other &ldquo;context information&rdquo; related to
        the communication process (metadata).
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all the technical data required for the processing of the online
        communication. This includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs, device type, operating
        system type and version, client version, camera type, microphone or loudspeaker and the type of connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should content be exchanged, uploaded, or otherwise made available within the tool, it is also stored on the
        servers of the tool provider. Such content includes, but is not limited to, cloud recordings, chat/ instant
        messages, voicemail uploaded photos and videos, files, whiteboards, and other information shared while using the
        service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that we do not have complete influence on the data processing procedures of the tools used. Our
        possibilities are largely determined by the corporate policy of the respective provider. Further information on
        data processing by the conference tools can be found in the data protection declarations of the tools used, and
        which we have listed below this text.
      </p>
      <h4>Purpose and legal bases</h4>
      <p>
        The conference tools are used to communicate with prospective or existing contractual partners or to offer
        certain services to our customers (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR). Furthermore, the use of the tools serves to generally
        simplify and accelerate communication with us or our company (legitimate interest in the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f)
        GDPR). Insofar as consent has been requested, the tools in question will be used on the basis of this consent;
        the consent may be revoked at any time with effect from that date.
      </p>
      <h4>Duration of storage</h4>
      <p>
        Data collected directly by us via the video and conference tools will be deleted from our systems immediately
        after you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage, or the reason for storing the data no longer
        applies. Stored cookies remain on your end device until you delete them. Mandatory legal retention periods
        remain unaffected.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have no influence on the duration of storage of your data that is stored by the operators of the conference
        tools for their own purposes. For details, please directly contact the operators of the conference tools.
      </p>
      <h4>Conference tools used</h4> <p>We employ the following conference tools:</p>
